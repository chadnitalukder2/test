        world. Our country was a part of Pakistan before 1971</p>
        <p> Then we freed our country and achieved victory after nine month’s liberation war. 3 million people sacrificed their lives in the liberation war in 1971. Our independence day is 26th March and Victory day is 16th December.</p>

It is also a matter of great pride for us that we are the only nation that sacrificed their lives for the sake of their mother tongue on 21st February of 1952. In order to show respect to them, UNESCO has declared 21st February as International Mother Language Day.</p>
